  <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
   <p>My practiced hobbies play a <u>significant role</u> in shaping my free time such as watching One Piece. I enjoy this activity because it allows me to relax after a long day of studying. There are many other hobbies that I will mention later on this page. My hobbies give me many benefits, such as learning different concepts in the world, but it could be wasting of time or boring to another person, so it depends.</p>
